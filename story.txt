Lee was a bully. Nobody liked him, but he always got his way. One day he was bullied, and he found out that being a bully was a bad thing. He decided not to be a bully anymore.
it's me xiangjun ma, I just inserted a new paragraph. Lee then went to a local bar and orderded five whiskies, he said to a guy next to him that he was waiting for someone. 
A large horse walked into the door and sat down next to Lee. He snorted in his face and said: "I don't have the goods with me today, but I do have some high quality brick. Smokes like finely aged pork." Lee made a look of disgust, but pulled out fourty freshly printed Mexican pseos from his coat pocket. "Fine, hand them over." The horse looked at him and said "Fourty? That can't even buy four ounces of spaghetti on the Eurasian black market. No deal."
Luckily for Lee, the Eurasian black market was running into financial issues due to the stress that Brexit is putting on the E.U economy, so with a little coaxing, the horse handing over the high quality brick for just fourty Mexican pesos and headed off to buy his damn spaghetti at a discounted rate.
